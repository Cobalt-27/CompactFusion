# prompt="A detailed wooden toy ship with intricately carved masts and sails is seen gliding smoothly over a plush, blue carpet that mimics the waves of the sea. The ship's hull is painted a rich brown, with tiny windows. The carpet, soft and textured, provides a perfect backdrop, resembling an oceanic expanse. Surrounding the ship are various other toys and children's items, hinting at a playful environment. The scene captures the innocence and imagination of childhood, with the toy ship's journey symbolizing endless adventures in a whimsical, indoor setting."
# prompt="A street artist, clad in a worn-out denim jacket and a colorful bandana, stands before a vast concrete wall in the heart, holding a can of spray paint, spray-painting a colorful bird on a mottled wall."
# prompt="The camera follows behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road surrounded by pine trees on a steep mountain slope, dust kicks up from itâ€™s tires, the sunlight shines on the SUV as it speeds along the dirt road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The dirt road curves gently into the distance, with no other cars or vehicles in sight. The trees on either side of the road are redwoods, with patches of greenery scattered throughout. The car is seen from the rear following the curve with ease, making it seem as if it is on a rugged drive through the rugged terrain. The dirt road itself is surrounded by steep hills and mountains, with a clear blue sky above with wispy clouds."
